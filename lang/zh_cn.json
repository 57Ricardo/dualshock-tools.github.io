    "Close": "",
    "Welcome to the F.A.Q. section! Below, you'll find answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about this website. If you have any other inquiries or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to me directly. Your feedback and questions are always welcome!": "",
    "How does it work?": "",
    "Behind the scenes, this website is the culmination of one year of dedicated effort in reverse-engineering DualShock controllers for fun/hobby from a random guy on the internet.": "",
    "Through": "",
    "this research": "",
    ", it was discovered that there exist some undocumented commands on DualShock controllers that can be sent via USB and are used during factory assembly process. If these commands are sent, the controller starts the recalibration of analog sticks.": "",
    "While the primary focus of this research wasn't initially centered on recalibration, it became apparent that a service offering this capability could greatly benefit numerous individuals. And thus, here we are.": "",
    "Does the calibration remain effective during gameplay on PS4/PS5?": "",
    "Yes, if you tick the checkbox \"Write changes permanently in the controller\". In that case, the calibration is flashed directly in the controller firmware. This ensures that it remains in place regardless of the console it's connected to.": "",
    "Is this an officially endorsed service?": "",
    "No, this service is simply a creation by a DualShock enthusiast.": "",
    "Does this website detects if a controller is a clone?": "",
    "Yes, only DualShock4 at the moment. This happened because I accidentally purchased some clones, spent time identifying the differences and added this functionality to prevent future deception.": "",
    "Unfortunately, the clones cannot be calibrated anyway, because they only clone the behavior of a DualShock4 during a normal gameplay, not all the undocumented functionalities.": "",
    "If you want to extend this detection functionality to DualSense, please ship me a fake DualSense and you'll see it in few weeks.": "",
    "What development is in plan?": "",

    "I maintain two separate to-do lists for this project, although the priority has yet to be established.": "",
    "The first list is about enhancing support for DualShock4 and DualSense controllers:": "",
    "Implement calibration of L2/R2 triggers.": "",
    "Improve detection of clones, particularly beneficial for those seeking to purchase used controllers with assurance of authenticity.": "",
    "Enhance user interface (e.g. provide additional controller information)": "",
    "Add support for recalibrating IMUs.": "",
    "Additionally, explore the possibility of reviving non-functioning DualShock controllers (further discussion available on Discord for interested parties).": "",
    "The second list contains new controllers I aim to support:": "",
    "DualSense Edge": "",
    "DualShock 3": "",
    "XBox Controllers": "",
    "Each of these tasks presents both immense interest and significant time investment. To provide context, supporting a new controller typically demands 6-12 months of full-time research, alongside a stroke of good fortune.": "",
    "I love this service, it helped me! How can I contribute?": "",
    "I'm glad to hear that you found this helpful! If you're interested in contributing, here are a few ways you can help me:": "",
    "Consider making a": "",
    "donation": "",
    "to support my late-night caffeine-fueled reverse-engineering efforts.": "",
    "Ship me a controller you would love to add (send me an email for organization).": "",
